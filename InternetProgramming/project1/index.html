                <p class="align-left">
                    My name is Mason Eastman and I'm 23 years old and I've lived in Jacksonville my whole life. My major is Information Science and my minor is Criminal Justice.
                    My major is Information Science and my minor is Criminal Justice. Originally, from childhood, I had a desire for Engineering and Architecture but my dad got
                    me interested in computers after introducing me to his first laptop in which I still revolve my life around.

                    Some interesting facts about myself are that I'm the only person in my family to pursue a STEM degree. My family owns a small horse farm in Western North
                    Carolina in which I visit at least once a year to see my grandparents. And I've always wanted to be a chef.

                <p class="align-left">
                    My hobbies are my girlfriend, video games, writing, and my friends. I'm not a very physical person so
                    my actiivities outside of hanging out or on the computer or Playstation are limited. One interesting hobby 
                    of mine is the card game Yu-Gi-Oh of which I sometimes play competitively.

                    I have not really touched on my writing since a year after I started college, but I used to write throughout
                    high school. My writing genre mainly consisted of fiction and a journal every now and then. I used to zone-out
                    in class to think of stories I could write about.

                <p class="align-left">
                    Originally my goal was to get a degree in a form of engineering and I chose Electrical Engineering as I found
                    electricity the most interesting. However, a year and a half into the degree I realized that it was not for
                    me and I switched to Information Science. I've enjoyed this major so far allowing me to work with the technology
                    I love and I recently just passed my Senior Project. I've had a growing interest in JavaScript and have been self
                    teaching.
